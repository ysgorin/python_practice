# anagrams.py

# An anagram is a new word formed by rearranging
# the letters of a word, using all the original
# letters exactly once.

# Write a program that asks the user for two
# separate texts, checks whether the entered
# texts are anagrams, and prints the result.

# Note:
# Assume that two empty strings are not anagrams
# Treat upper- and lower-case letters as equal
# Spaces are not taken into account during the check - treat them as non-existent
