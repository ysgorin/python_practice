# Character Frequency Histogram

# Write a program that asks that
# - asks the user for the input file's name;
# - reads the file and counts all the Latin
# letters (lower- and upper-case letters are
# treated as equal)
# - prints a simple histogram in alphabetical
# order (only non-zero counts should be
# presented)

# Expected output based on test_file.txt:
# a -> 1
# b -> 1
# c -> 1
