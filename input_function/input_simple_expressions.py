# Your task is to complete the code in order to
# evaluate the results of four basic arithmetic operations.
# The results have to be printed to the console.
# You may not be able to protect the code from
# a user who wants to divide by zero.
# That's okay, don't worry about it for now.

# Starter Code:
# input a float value for variable a here
# input a float value for variable b here

# output the result of addition here
# output the result of subtraction here
# output the result of multiplication here
# output the result of division here

# print("\nThat's all, folks!")

a,b = float(input('Enter a number: ')), float(input('Enter a number: '))

print('a + b =',(a+b),'\na - b =',(a-b),'\n\
a * b =',(a*b),'\na / b =',(a/b))
